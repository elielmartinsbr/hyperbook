Add the snippet element. Snippets are helpful for making the handling of repeated blocks easiert. For example you can define a protect-block, which uses the same password across your hyperbook in a snippet. If you want to change the password, you can just change it in the snippet. See the documentation for snippets to get a more in detail view on snippets.
