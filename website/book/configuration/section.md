# Section Configuration

Each folder inside `book` defines a section. Each folder must contain a `index.md`. The index file
can be configured like a [page](/configuration/page).

If the `index.md` file only contains a front matter and is otherwise
empty, it will appear in the navigation as a non-clickable item.
