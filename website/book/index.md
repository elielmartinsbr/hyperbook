# Hyperbook

Hyperbook is a quick and easy way to build interactive workbooks, that
support modern standards and run superfast. It works by compiling
markdown to static pages.

Hyperbook makes writing interactive workbooks super simple while providing a
good feature set.

You do not need any coding experience. You only need to create and edit Markdown files.

## Getting Started

1. Run `npx hyperbook new` and follow the wizard to create your first Hyperbook.
1. Run `npx hyperbook dev` to start the development server.
1. Modify or add new pages to your Hyperbook.
1. Run `npx hyperbook build` to create static files.
1. Upload the static files to your server.

## Update

Update to the latest release of Hyperbook CLI using the following command.

```bash
npm update hyperbook --global
```

The Hyperbook template can be updated by running the setup command:

```bash
hyperbook setup
```
